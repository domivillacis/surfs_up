# Surfs Up

#	Overview of the statistical analysis:

In this project I'm going to help W. Avy, who after visiting Hawaii many times, came up with the idea of opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, with the purpose of serving tourists and locals, and of course to make sure that she can return to hawaii at any time.

She is currently looking for people to invest in her business, but before convincing the interested parties, W. Avy asked me to help her analyze the climate to demonstrate that her business idea will be a success.

To make sure this analysis is accurate, I'll be using new query methods like SQLite, SQLalchemy, and Flask, and some Python code to graph and store a DataFrame.

# Results

• Based on our analysis, we can see that the total temperature count in June was 1700 and in December it was 1517, which definitely indicates that June has much more movement in temperature.

• Also, June and December temperatures average 74 and 71 respectively, which means the weather is still good for opening a surf and ice cream shop.

• On the other hand, the lowest temperature for both months is 64 and 56 respectively, which can be a bit challenging, especially if W. Avy wants ice cream to be the best seller product of the shop.
