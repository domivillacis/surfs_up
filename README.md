# Surfs Up

#	Overview of the statistical analysis:

In this project I'm going to help W. Avy, who after visiting Hawaii many times, came up with the idea of opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, with the purpose of serving tourists and locals, and of course to make sure that he can return to Hawaii at any time.

He is currently looking for people to invest in his business, but before convincing the interested parties, W. Avy asked me to help him analyze the climate to demonstrate that his business idea will be a success.

To make sure this analysis is accurate, I'll be using new query methods like SQLite, SQLalchemy, and Flask, and some Python code to graph and store a DataFrame.

# Results

• Based on our analysis, we can see that the total temperature count in June was 1700 and in December it was 1517, for both months the count is high enough to make it a realiable data set.

• Also, June and December temperatures average 74 and 71 respectively, which means the weather is still good for opening a surf and ice cream shop.

• On the other hand, the lowest temperature for both months is 64 and 56 respectively, which can be a bit challenging, especially if W. Avy wants ice cream to be the best seller product of the shop.

# Summary

The results of this analysis are not as clear on whether W. Avy should start the new business because this analysis is based on only two months of the year, whereas a 12-month, full-year analysis would be more valuable and accurate to better identify high, shoulder and low season.

Additionally, to help W. Avy further his analysis, I would also create a query to find rainfall data by month.

The main reason is because the higher temperatures of June and December are perfect for the new business and would definitely attract a lot of customers. However, there is a big difference in the lowest temperature results for both months, especially for December, 56 degrees.

I would definitely suggest W. Avy to plot the results for each month per year to see exactly how the weather will affect his business and if he can adjust his product offering and staff seasonally. Like hot chocolate or a good quality wetsuit for surfing, for example.
